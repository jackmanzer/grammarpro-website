        <h2>Test Prep</h2>

        <p>
          I tutor the reading, writing, and essay sections of the SAT and ACT
          exclusively. I do not tutor the math or science sections; however, I
          do have a tutor I highly recommend that I would be happy to connect
          you with.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          The sobering fact is that most students in the U.S. do not recieve
          adequate reading, writing, or grammar instruction in primary and
          secondary school. If grammar is taught, it's usually taught poorly. I
          can radically improve a student’s score through grammar instruction,
          but that only solves half the problem: most of the questions on the
          SAT are about the text itself, requiring an understanding of writing
          functionality as well as a well-rounded academic vocabulary. Such
          knowledge and understanding can only be gained through motivated
          participation in thoughtful reading and writing instruction. For a
          variety of reasons, very little of this occurs in public, even
          private, schools today.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          As a result, when most high school students attempt the SAT or ACT,
          typically at the beginning of their junior year, they perform poorly.
          Not only is the material difficult and the pace excessive, but the
          tests (especially the SAT) are also specifically designed to trick
          students. It's the perfect storm.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Consequently, in order to perform well on the SAT and ACT reading and
          writing sections, most students have to play catchup&#8212;fast. The
          good news is that, with the right mindset, coaching, and work ethic, I
          have seen students make dramatic improvements to their scores. To find
