                    <h2>College Essays</h2>
                    <p>Though it will not replace a poor GPA or lack of meaningful extracurriculars, 
                        a well-written college essay can really set you apart from the crowd. Though most 
                        students are familiar with the routine dictum “show don’t tell,” many produce 
                        essays that read like resumes: lists of achievements along with familiar, uninspired 
                        repetitions of ensuing skills, abilities, and platitudes.</p> 

                    <p class="indent margin-bottom">Inevitably, if you convey even the faintest attempt at thoughtful reflection&#8212;actually 
                        thinking about the specifics of your experience&#8212;you are likely to wake up an admissions 
                        official; only then can you convince them how great a person you are. 
                        And so we come to the principal aims of any good college essay:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="margin-bottom">
                        <li>To convince your reader that you are an interesting, 
                            likeable person with a good deal of self-knowledge.</li> 
                        <li>To make them believe that the world will be a better 
                            place if they admit you into their university.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="margin-bottom">How do you write it? By giving concrete and specific answers to two important questions:</p> 
                   
                    <ul class="margin-bottom">
                       <li>What were the influences (experiences, mentors, books) that lead you to the passion for your 
                       field of choice? Pack in as many rich specifics as possible.</li> 
                       <li>How will your participation in specific coursework and programs enable you to be a part of something that will move 
                       humanity towards a brighter future?</li> 
                    </ul>

                    <p>The answers to these questions are what every good college really cares about. 
                        They want to know how you have come to look at your world and your purpose within 
                        it at the cusp of this important chapter in your life. An honest attempt to grasp 
                        how specific experiences have led you to this purpose will make you come 
                        across as an earnest, thoughtful, highly-motivated, altruistically-minded individual. 
                        If you do it right, admission to this particular university will seem like the 
                        natural next step towards a career that will have a veritable impact on human welfare.</p> 

                    <p class="indent">Naturally, writing such an essay can be fairly difficult. That’s why I’m here. My job is 
                        to help you tease out those specifics, to guide you through weaving them together 
                        into a cohesive narrative, and to teach you how to express your ideas 
                        in clear, confident, grammatically-correct, language.</p>    
                    
                    <p class="indent margin-bottom">And for those who feel like they may have nothing to say, you’re simply mistaken. 
                        I’ve never met a student who didn’t have something substantial. You’re just 
                        an uncut diamond. Everything you need is already there; I’m just 
                        going to help you bring it out.</p>
