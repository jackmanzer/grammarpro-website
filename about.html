    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>A homeschooled child of a former college professor and a school teacher,
        Jack had a rather unique upbringing.</p> 
        
        
    <p>A love of learning was fostered from
        the start, along with an emphasis on the written word and the intellectual
        life. Currently, Jack wears multiple hats: aside from tutoring, he also does
        freelance web and instructional design. But tutoring is by far his favorite
        hat, for the the little victories and “light bulb moments” that make the
        occupation so rewarding.</p>
